# Self-Balancing bot

> _This repo is maintained by students of VJTI,Mumbai_


The aim of this project is to develop a Self-Balancing bot using LPC1768 Arm Microcontroller and using Genetic algorithm to make it balance without being explicitly coded. The bot will learn how to balance on its own and will be able to incorporate many different environmental conditions. 

#Firmware

The LPC1768 ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller from NXP Semiconductors is used.
The reference for all the peripheral drivers can be found in the Hydra Documentation folder.
